        <p>
            Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a decision-making algorithm that has revolutionized the way artificial intelligence (AI) systems make strategic choices, especially in complex environments such as games, robotics, and simulations. At its core, MCTS helps systems explore different future possibilities by simulating random outcomes. It then builds a "tree" of decisions, using the results of these simulations to guide future actions toward the most promising paths. This makes MCTS both powerful and efficient at solving problems that involve many potential choices.        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm works by balancing two key ideas: exploration, where it tries out new possibilities, and exploitation, where it focuses on the most promising options based on what it has learned so far. One famous application of MCTS is in game-playing AI systems, such as AlphaGo, where it was used to outsmart human champions in the board game Go. Beyond games, MCTS is increasingly being applied in robotics to help robots make decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments.        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we explore how Monte Carlo Tree Search can be adapted and applied to decision-making in robotic systems. We explain the algorithm in simple terms, show how it can be used in real-world robotics scenarios, and discuss its potential to improve how robots navigate, interact with their surroundings, and make autonomous decisions.        </p>
